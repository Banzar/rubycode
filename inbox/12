Sent you the message below to your email address last week. Let me know if you got it.
Hello, Hope you are doing well. First can you tell us what our balance is that we owe you? Second, my account at Wells Fargo was compromised and funds were taken out that I did not authorize. The bank is in the process of correcting everything but it maybe be several days before we have money back in the account to send you.. I can show you letters from the bank if you would like. Let me know if this is too much of an issue and I will see if there is anything else we can do like borrow the money. I hope this will not inconvenience you too much. Thanks
