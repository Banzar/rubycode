I did see that this was part time, and depending on the pay and the amount
of hours I would get, the commute would be fine.

I of course would need more information to know if this would be workable
for me. I am currently employed, so part time works, but the schedule would
be a key factor.

I thought that this may be something we would be able to discuss when we
met.

To not waste your time, I currently am working a permanent schedule that is:

5 days a week, with Tuesdays and Saturdays off, 7:00am until 3:30pm, so if
this is not workable I would understand. And if it is, I would love to work
towards a more permanent and full time position.
