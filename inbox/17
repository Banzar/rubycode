Hi David,

     Sorry about the delay in response, still getting caught up from the
Thanksgiving holiday over here. Thanks so much for the info! We can work
with those hours. Before we bring you in for an interview, we ask that all
applicants complete the included coding practical. It's just the best way
for us to get a handle on your skill-set. Please let me know if you have
any questions, thanks!

*Coding Practical*

*Languages Accepted: Ruby, Python and PHP*

*Parsing an Email*

What do we mean by parse an email? Go to Gmail, open an incoming email, and
do View Original. You should see a text file of a raw email. The goal here
is to parse that and extract relevant fields.
This is actually a very difficult thing and a proper implementation could
take months. However, it's possible to do the basics, without handling all
of the intricacies, in maybe an hour.

*Your goals:*

   - Take in an email and parse it into relevant fields. Figure out what
   those relevant fields are.
   - Create a good foundation. Try to write extensible/maintainable code.
   - When you're done, list out next steps you'd take in your
   implementation. Eg, 'I'd focus on handling different MIME types in the
   body', etc.
   - Don't use a library like TMail that does parsing for you, but feel
   free to use any non- email-specific libraries you want to.

*A few notes about your goals:*

   - The directions are purposefully vague. Make decisions on what you
   think is best for the goal you're trying to accomplish. Feel free to tell
   us why you made certain decisions in your summary.
   - Use the RFC Email Specs as a starting point to help you parse the
   email.
   - Google is your friend!
